# mobileBot
A simple locomotive bot built on Arduino, that can be controlled with a pair of phones - via a phone call (*hint:* DTMF).

### motivation
This is a prelimainary project, and is of beginner difficulty. It will help you in understanding a microcontroller prototype-development board (ex. Arduino), and have fun along the way.

### about the repo
The repo consists only of the arduino sketch that needs to be uploaded on the Arduino Uno board. The details of basic working and the pin configuration has been discussed in the PDF, for reference.
